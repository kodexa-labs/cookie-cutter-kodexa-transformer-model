# Cookiecutter Kodexa Transformer Model

A cookiecutter template for creating Kodexa transformer models.

## What is a Kodexa Transformer?

A Kodexa transformer is a specialized model that processes and transforms documents within the Kodexa platform. Transformers can:

- Extract data from documents
- Modify document content
- Generate new metadata
- Apply business logic to documents
- Convert between document formats
- Enhance documents with additional features

Transformers are used in Kodexa pipelines to build sophisticated document processing workflows.

## Features

- Creates a fully functional Kodexa transformer model
- Includes proper project structure and configuration
- Provides sample implementation for the transformer
- Includes documentation templates
- Ready for deployment to Kodexa platform

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Cookiecutter (`pip install cookiecutter`)

### Creating a New Project

To create a new transformer model, run:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:kodexa-ai/cookie-cutter-kodexa-transformer-model
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project.

## Project Structure

The generated project includes:

- A Python package with the transformer implementation
- Model metadata for Kodexa platform integration
