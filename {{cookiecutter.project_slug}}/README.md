## Overview

This is a Kodexa transformer model that processes documents and applies transformations to them. Transformers are an essential part of the Kodexa platform, allowing you to manipulate and extract data from documents in a pipeline.

## Features

* Kodexa document transformer model
* Extensible transformer architecture
* Configurable through transformer options
* Seamless integration with Kodexa pipelines
* Support for various document content types

## Installation

Once published to your Kodexa organization, you can use this transformer model in your pipelines.

## Usage

This transformer model can be used within Kodexa processing pipelines to transform documents. The `Transformer` class in the `transformer.py` file contains the core transformation logic.

### In Kodexa Pipelines

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "transform",
      "model": "{{cookiecutter.org_slug}}/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}",
      "parameters": {
        "transformer_options": {
          "your_option": "value"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Programmatically

```python
from {{ cookiecutter.pkg_name }} import Transformer

# Initialize the transformer with options
transformer = Transformer(options={'your_option': 'value'})

# Apply the transformation to a document
transformed_document = transformer.transform(document)
```

## Configuration

The transformer accepts the following configuration options:

* `your_option`: Description of what this option does (replace with your actual options)

## Development

To extend or modify this transformer:

1. Update the `transform` method in `transformer.py` with your transformation logic
2. Test your changes with sample documents
3. Deploy to your Kodexa organization
